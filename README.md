# PostgreSQL V12
This asset will allow Blue Prism to connect directly to a PostgreSQL database via SQL. You will need a host (IP) address, a port number (usually 5432), a user id and password.

# Connectivity
Connectivity is provided by C# code using the npgsql library which can be found at nuget (www.nuget.org) and documentation can be found at www.npgsql.org. 

# Usage
For usage of this VBO asset, no knowledge of C# development is required, unless you intend to extend its functionality. You will however require some SQL and schema knowledge to use the asset.

# More Information
You can find more information about npgsql at http://www.npgsql.org/doc/installation.html.
